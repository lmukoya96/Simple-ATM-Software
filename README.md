This simple project essentially creates a simulation of an ATM software. Just like an ATM, the program should has the following features:

Checking whether an input – such as an ATM card (a debit/credit card number) – is recorded correctly
Verifying the user by asking for a PIN
In case of negative verification, logging out the user
In case of positive verification, showing multiple options, including cash availability, the previous five transactions, and cash withdrawal
Giving the user the ability to withdraw up to 10,000 worth of cash in one transaction, with total transactions limited to ten per day.
